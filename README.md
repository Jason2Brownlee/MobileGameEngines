# Mobile Game Engines

This is an archive of books and material for the **Mobile Game Engines** project, circa 2012-2013.

## About

This project started off as a list of all game engines intended for developing games for IOS, Android and HTML5.

It was turned into a website that listed all game engines hosed at `MobileGameEngines.com`. The website was developed using ruby on rails and was hosted on heroku.

Developers of game engines and developers of games using the game engines were interviewed, resulting in the publication of two books.

## Website

The website was hosted at:

* [MobileGameEngines.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20140203020740/http://mobilegameengines.com/) (archived)

The code and database for the website was not archived.
